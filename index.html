    <h1> About Me </h1>
  </div>

  <div class= "flexWrapper noSlide">

      <p id = "flex1"> Hi, my name is Alexander Levin I am currently a Cybersecurity Major at Northeastern University. 
        I have always been interested in Cybersecurity at a young age when I would try and hack trivial browser games. 
        It wasn't until high school where I would take my first Cybersecurity class that I would realize that I would want to pursue a career in Cybersecurity. 
      </p>
      <p id = "flex2"> Though I didnt get introduced into Cybersecurity until junior year of high school I found my love for computers when I built my first one when I was 13. I was fascinated by every aspect of my computer, the hardware, the software, all of it.
        With building my first computer I was introduced to video games which would become a very important passion of mine. I didnt realize how big until I would be trying out and sucuessfully making it on one of the Northeastern Valorant teams where I would be a collegiate e-sports player.
      </p>
      <p id = "flex3"> Though computers and video games are very important and special passions of mine, some of my other interests include skiing, web development, travelling, and video editing. </p>
